### To Run the programme 

- ```python3 code.py```

### Results :
- The programme runs through the file and generates a **valid block** that tries to have maximum fee, keeping the total weight less than the **maximum_block_weight** i.e. *4,000,000*

- The programme uses a greedy approach towards solution, uses a factor of ```F/W``` i.e. density to judge which transaction to select and which one to reject. 

- The code takes around 30 seconds to run, so please wait while it runs. 

- As per my programme, the block has a total ***fee_sum of 5,801,519*** with total ***weight_sum of 3,999,008***.
